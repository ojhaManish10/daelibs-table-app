**1. Introduction:**

Purpose: The application aims to display a table of data with relevant success and fail labels, indicating whether the actual score for each entry meets the target score or not. The main goal is to provide users with a visually appealing and interactive table representation.

Features: The application includes the following features:

A responsive and visually appealing table layout.
Hover effect on table rows for a more interactive experience.
Success and fail labels displayed in a button-like style, indicating target achievement.
Modern styling with subtle box-shadow and rounded corners for the table container.
Technologies Used: The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. CSS is utilized for styling, and the application is designed to be responsive and compatible with various devices.

**2. Installation:**

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

Getting Started: To run the application, follow these steps:

Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
After the installation, run npm start to start the development server.
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.


**3. Usage:**

Running the Application: Once the application is running, you can access it through your web browser using the provided URL (http://localhost:3000). The table will be displayed with sample data.

Interacting with the Table: The table presents data for each entry with columns: "First Name," "Last Name," "Target," "Actual," and "Points." Rows with hover effect will change their background color to coral, providing a visual feedback when the user hovers over them. The "Success" and "Fail" labels in the "Actual" column indicate whether the actual score meets the target score. Green represents success, while red represents fail.


**4. Components:**

App.js: The main component that renders the application. It imports the List component and provides sample data for rendering the table.

List.js: This component is responsible for rendering the table and data. It receives the data as props and maps through it to generate table rows with success and fail labels based on the actual and target scores.

List.css: The CSS file for styling the components, including the table, hover effects, and success/fail labels.

**5. Styling:**

Table Styling: The table is styled with a subtle box-shadow and rounded corners to give it a modern appearance. The header row has a slightly lighter gray background color to distinguish it from the data rows.

Hover Effects: When hovering over the table rows, the background color changes to a soft coral color, providing a smooth transition and interactivity.

Success/Fail Labels: The "Success" and "Fail" labels are styled as buttons within the table cells. The labels have different background colors (green for success and red for fail) to indicate target achievement.

**6. Enhancements:**

Customization Options: Users can customize the table appearance, such as changing colors, font sizes, and spacing, by modifying the CSS styles in List.css.

Adding More Data: The application can handle larger datasets by providing additional entries to the data array in App.js. The table will dynamically render the data accordingly.

Integration with APIs: For real-world applications, data can be fetched from APIs or databases by using asynchronous functions like fetch or integrating with backend services.
